# Material Design for Ember.js Apps [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/secondstreet/ember-material.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/secondstreet/ember-material)

[Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/) is a specification for a
unified system of visual, motion, and interaction design that adapts across different devices. Our
goal is to deliver a lean, lightweight set of Ember.js-native UI elements that implement the
material design specification for use in Ember single-page applications (SPAs).

This project is in early pre-release. Ember Material is both a reference implementation of
Material Design and a complementary effort to the [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/)
project's [Paper Elements](https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/elements/paper-elements.html)
collection, and to the [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) project's
[Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/) project.

browser version.
